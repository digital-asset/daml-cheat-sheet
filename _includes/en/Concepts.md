| `Party` | A party represents a person or legal entity (for example a bank). Parties can create contracts and exercise choices and are represented by the `Party` data type in DAML.<br><br>|
| `Signatories, observers, and controllers` | Signatories, observers, and controllers are parties involved in actions taken on a contract, i.e., actions that are *exercised* on a contract. Signatories, observers, and controllers are therefore represented by the `Party` data type. <br><br>|
| `Contract` | Contracts are created from blueprints called `templates` - this is the DAML code you write. Templates include:<br><br>- contract data (e.g., date, description, parties involved etc.)<br>- roles (signatory, observer)<br>- choices and their respective controllers (*who* gets to do *what*)<br><br>Every contract is a *template instance* stored as a row on the ledger. Contracts are immutable: once they are created on the ledger, the information in the contract cannot be changed. In order to "change" a contract you need to create a new one with the desired contract data. <br><br>|
| `Choice` | A choice is something that a party can exercise (take action) on a contract. Choices give you a way to transform the data in a contract: while the contract itself is immutable, you can write a choice that archives the contract and creates a new version of it with the updated data. <br><br> A choice can only be exercised by its controller and contains the `authorization` of all of the contract's signatories as well as of the controller. In other words, a choice cannot be exercised unless it has been previously signed by the necessary parties. <br><br>|
| `Ledger` | Ledger represents the storage where all contracts are recorded. More information on DAML Ledgers can be found <a href="https://docs.daml.com/concepts/ledger-model/ledger-structure.html#ledgers">here</a>.<br><br> |
