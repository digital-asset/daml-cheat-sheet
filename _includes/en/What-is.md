[Daml](https://daml.com) is an open-source smart contract language designed to build composable
applications on an abstract ledger model.

Daml is a high level language that focuses on data privacy and authorization of distributed
applications. These concepts are represented first class in the language.

By abstracting data privacy and authorization, Daml takes the burden off the programmer to think
about concrete cryptographic primitives and lets her focus on workflow logic.

Daml is a statically typed functional language.

Applications specified in Daml can be deployed on a growing number of platforms including
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora"> Amazon Aurora </a>,
<a href="https://vmware.github.io/concord-bft"> VMWare Concord </a>,
